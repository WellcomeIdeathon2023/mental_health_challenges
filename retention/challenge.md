# Develop a platform for long-term participant retention

## Background

Retaining participants with mental health problems in mental health and in clinical research studies is notoriously difficult. Participant dropout may result in trials underpowered to detect a treatment effect and can be a particular issue when there is differential dropout among treatment arms. This problem
is compounded in longitudinal studies that require participants to remain in the study for long time periods (for example, 10+ years). Potential solutions to this must consider individual participant needs around communication, for example some participants may prefer telephone calls, others may prefer messaging on an app, and others may prefer in-person conversations.

## Challenge

Design an approach to improve long-term retention of participants with
mental health problems in a study. In the long-term, we are interested in both researcher- and participant-facing ideas that can help with long-term (10+ years) retention. However, for your prototype you should focus on the front-end for either researchers or participants. For researchers this could include (but is not limited to), logging of participant information and requirements, notifications, and reminders. For participants this could include (but is not limited to) machine learning (for example, for adaptive user-design), gamification, preferences,
and much more. You should focus particularly on tools that can be used in
early intervention studies in adolescents and young adults.

## Questions to answer in your presentation

1. How does your design improve the long-term retention of participants with mental health problems in a clinical research study?
2. How would you evaluate the impact of your application? How could you discover early utility of the application and likelihood of success in ten years within a shorter time period?
3. How have you considered the needs and requirements of research participants and researchers?
