# Develop an interactive application for finding and accessing clinical trials

## Background

At any point in time there are many clinical trials seeking volunteer participants. These inform scientific progress and provide participants with access to cutting-edge, experimental treatments as well as payment for their time. However, uptake in mental health trials is not as high as for other conditions, such as cancer. Furthermore, if a participant did want to participate in a trial, current platforms are not particularly visible or easy to find and are limited in scope. For example, the [MQ Mental Health platform](https://participate.mqmentalhealth.org/) is limited in the number of trials it offers and the [NIHR platform](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/clinical-trialsguide/20595) is not user-friendly. Other prominent examples include [NHS DigiTrials](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-digitrials) and NIHR’s [Be Part of Research](https://bepartofresearch.nihr.ac.uk/) – whilst both these platforms are user-friendly, they are not mental health-focused and are restricted to the UK. Moreover, they do not cover the entire end-to-end user journey, and do not consider the range of possible users, including both research participants and researchers. To accelerate research, there needs
to be a cultural shift towards more participants with mental health problems wanting to participate in, and having access to, ongoing clinical trials.

## Challenge

Design an application (app) to help people with mental health problems search
for ongoing and upcoming clinical trials that they can participate in. As with the previous challenge, in the long-term we are interested in an app that can be valuable to the full range of researchers and participants listed above, but for
now please just focus on meeting the needs of participants from diverse backgrounds. The app should enable a stronger connection between participants and researchers by removing dependencies on third parties (for example, social media sites) and allowing potential participants to filter by preference (for
example type of intervention, frequency of visits/data collection sessions). We are particularly interested in solutions that can be utilised for the entire user journey from discovering trials and signing up, to updates/notifications from the research team and follow-up surveys and more. For your prototype you can focus on developing a platform for finding and accessing trials, but you should also consider how your application could be broadened into a comprehensive resource that can be used for: public engagement, communications and outreach, educational tools and resources, and the platform for finding, accessing, and taking part in trials.

## Questions to answer in your presentation

1. How does your design improve upon existing platforms?
2. How will your platform ensure it attracts people from diverse backgrounds and with heterogenous symptoms and interests?
3. How have you considered the needs and requirements of research participants and researchers?
